## Project Description
We are interested in investigating these questions because it could give us insight into how human infrastructure and population could be related to increased water pollution and air quality. While correlation does not mean causation, the impacts on the environment could very well be related to human interaction. This is important because air quality and water pollution not only affects our eco systems, but also our quality of life with every breath we take. We will primarily be using a dataset from 2021 derived from Kaggle titled “World’s Air Quality and Water Pollution Dataset.” According to the World Health Organization, Ambient (outdoor) air pollution has caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. 2.2 billion people remain without access to safe drinking water, and polluted water causes an estimated 1 million deaths each year, with 395,000 of those deaths coming from children under 5 years of age. With our visualizations we hope to display which parts of the world need cleaner water and safer quality of air.

### Questions of interest
- Are there any correlations or associations between air quality and water pollution levels in specific regions?
- Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of air pollution and water pollution, and are they regionally correlated? 

### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
1. Poor air quality and high water pollution have a negative impact on ecosystems and the organisms within them that support our quality of life.
2. By discovering which regions or countries that have the highest and lowest air and water pollution, policy makers in those areas can make educated decisions on how to approach the issue.
3. Air pollution can also have an affect on respiratory related diseases [LINK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740163/)


Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but which specific countries need to be prioritized when improving worldwide water quality.



## Data Description
For our data we will be using the following columns:
- City
- Region
- Country
- AirQuality
- WaterPollution

## Interpreting Visualizations
Here are visualizations

This world map shows the grade of water pollution on a country-by-country basis. A grade of 0 means the water is of amazing quality, while a grade of 100 means the water is very polluted. 

Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but which specific countries need to be prioritized when improving worldwide water quality.

This world map shows the grade of air pollution on a country-by-country basis. A grade of 0 means the air is of poor quality, while a grade of 100 means the air is of high quality. 

Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but which specific countries need to limit their carbon footprint in order for its citizens to have fresher air.

This line graph shows a comparison between average air quality compared to average water pollution in the United States. The blue line represents water pollution while the orange line represents air quality. This graph shows that water pollution and air quality follow a similar pattern to each other - with some discrepancies - which could indicate that a positive correlation exists between the two.

Explanation:
As shown in visualization #3, the likeness of the air quality and water pollution line patterns could suggest that both water pollution and air quality should be equally weighed when considering factors that could negatively impact one or both.

The line chart compares the air quality and water pollution levels across multiple countries. The orange line indicates the water pollution levels, and the blue line represents the air quality levels.

Explanation: 
The bar chart showcases the comparative air quality and water pollution levels across various countries, displaying contrasting trends with peaks inversely proportional to each other. While the air quality tends to peak in certain nations, indicating higher pollution levels, their corresponding water pollution levels notably diminish, suggesting an intriguing inverse relationship. However, amidst these opposing trends, some countries exhibit correlating points where both air quality and water pollution levels align, hinting at shared environmental management strategies or geographical influences.

## Discussion and summary
As shown in visualization #3, the likeness of the air quality and water pollution line patterns could suggest that both water pollution and air quality should be equally weighed when considering factors that could negatively impact one or both. Also noted in visulations 1 and 2 we can see that air quality and water pollution do have a correlation with each othter, however, they are not always positively correlated with each other.
