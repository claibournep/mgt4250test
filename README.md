## Project Description
We are interested in investigating these questions because they could give us insight into how human infrastructure and population could be related to increased water pollution and air quality. While correlation does not mean causation, the impacts on the environment could very well be related to human interaction. This is important because air quality and water pollution not only affect our ecosystems but also our quality of life with every breath we take. We will primarily be using a dataset from 2021 derived from Kaggle titled “World’s Air Quality and Water Pollution Dataset.” According to the World Health Organization, Ambient (outdoor) air pollution has caused an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2019. 2.2 billion people remain without access to safe drinking water, and polluted water causes an estimated 1 million deaths each year, with 395,000 of those deaths coming from children under 5 years of age. With our visualizations, we hope to display which parts of the world need cleaner water and safer quality of air.

**NOTE: The data set has to be downloaded if you want to use the .twb file on its own**

### Questions of interest
- Are there any correlations or associations between air quality and water pollution levels in specific regions?
- Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of air pollution and water pollution, and are they regionally correlated? 

### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
1. Poor air quality and high water pollution have a negative impact on ecosystems and the organisms within them that support our quality of life.
2. By discovering which regions or countries have the highest and lowest air and water pollution, policymakers in those areas can make educated decisions on how to approach the issue.
3. Air pollution can also have an effect on respiratory-related diseases [LINK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740163/)


Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but which specific countries need to be prioritized when improving worldwide water quality.



## Data Description
For our data we will be using the following columns:

## Interpreting Visualizations
Here are visualizations

This world map shows the grade of water pollution on a country-by-country basis. A grade of 0 means the water is of amazing quality, while a grade of 100 means the water is very polluted. 

Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but which specific countries need to be prioritized when improving worldwide water quality.

This world map shows the grade of air pollution on a country-by-country basis. A grade of 0 means the air is of poor quality, while a grade of 100 means the air is of high quality. 

Explanation: This graph allows us to see not only which regions, but also which specific countries need to limit their carbon footprint in order for their citizens to have fresher air.

This line graph shows a comparison between average air quality compared to average water pollution in the United States. The blue line represents water pollution while the orange line represents air quality. This graph shows that water pollution and air quality follow a similar pattern to each other - with some discrepancies - which could indicate that a positive correlation exists between the two.

Explanation:
As shown in visualization #3, the likeness of the air quality and water pollution line patterns could suggest that both water pollution and air quality should be equally weighed when considering factors that could negatively impact one or both.

This line chart compares the air quality and water pollution levels across multiple countries. The orange line indicates the water pollution levels, and the blue line represents the air quality levels.

Explanation: 
The chart showcases the comparative air quality and water pollution levels across various countries, displaying contrasting trends with peaks inversely proportional to each other. While the air quality tends to peak in certain nations, indicating higher pollution levels, their corresponding water pollution levels notably diminish, suggesting an intriguing inverse relationship. However, amidst these opposing trends, some countries exhibit correlating points where both air quality and water pollution levels align, hinting at shared environmental management strategies or geographical influences.

## Discussion and summary
As shown in visualization #3, the likeness of the air quality and water pollution line patterns could suggest that both water pollution and air quality should be equally weighed when considering factors that could negatively impact one or both. Also noted in visualizations 1 and 2 we can see that air quality and water pollution do correlate with each other, however, they are not always positively correlated with each other. 

In articles written by the World Health Organization (WHO), they also believe that there is a regional correlation between air pollution and poor water quality. Regarding air quality, low- and middle-income nations have it the worst; specifically countries in Southeastern Asia and Western Pacific. However, the WHO also says that 99% of the world's population is breathing in air that does not meet the WHO's guidelines. In the realm of bad water, 2.2 billion people do not have access to consistently safe and clean water, and the majority of those people reside in Africa and Asia.

We wanted to see what ChatGPT would have as answers to our questions, so we decided to put them into GPT 4. We asked the generative AI these questions:

-Are there any correlations or associations between air quality and water pollution levels in specific regions? 
-Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of air pollution, and are they regionally correlated? 
-Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of water pollution, and are they regionally correlated?

These were the answers that GPT 4 had for the questions:

-There can be correlations between air quality and water pollution levels in specific regions. For instance, industrial regions often have both poor air and water quality due to emissions from factories. Pollutants in the air can also be deposited in bodies of water through precipitation, thereby affecting water quality. However, the correlation is not always direct or straightforward, as there are many factors that can influence both air and water quality, including geographical features, weather patterns, population density, and local environmental regulations.

-According to the World Health Organization, countries with the highest levels of air pollution include India, Nepal, Niger, Qatar, and Bangladesh. On the other hand, countries with the lowest levels of air pollution include Australia, Brunei, New Zealand, Finland, and Estonia.

-For water pollution, countries like Bangladesh, India, and China have been reported to have high levels due to industrial waste and poor waste management systems. Countries with the cleanest water systems include Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland.

-High levels of air pollution do not always correlate with high levels of water pollution. For example, while Qatar has one of the highest levels of air pollution, it does not rank as high in water pollution. Similarly, while Finland has one of the lowest levels of air pollution, it also has one of the cleanest water systems. This shows that regional correlation between air and water pollution can vary greatly depending on a multitude of factors.

When comparing GPT 4's answers, the visualizations that were made, and the articles mentioned, we can say with certainty that they are incredibly similar. Some countries are scored with a high air pollution level while having a lower water pollution level. However in some regions of the world, specifically Africa and Asia, there is a noticeable correlation between high air and water pollution levels.
