# MGT4250 Fall 2023 Course Project 
Author: Claibourne Porter, cporter9@elon.edu
## Project Description

### Questions of interest
- Are there any correlations or associations between air quality and water pollution levels in specific regions?
- Which regions or countries have the highest and lowest levels of air pollution and water pollution, and are they regionally correlated? 

### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
1. Poor air quality and high water pollution have a negative impact on ecosystems and the organisms within them that support our quality of life.
2. By discovering which regions or countries that have the highest and lowest air and water pollution, policy makers in those areas can make educated decisions on how to approach the issue.
3. Air pollution can also have an affect on respiratory related diseases [LINK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740163/)
